# FraudEX: Real-Time Fraud Detection System

FraudEX is a cutting-edge **real-time fraud detection system** designed to identify and flag suspicious financial transactions using machine learning. The system leverages advanced algorithms to analyze transaction patterns, reduce false positives, and provide actionable insights to financial institutions. Additionally, it integrates **Retell AI** for phone call notifications and **Twilio** for seamless communication.

## **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Analyzes transaction patterns in real-time to detect fraudulent activities.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML algorithms to minimize false positives and improve accuracy.
- **Phone Call Notifications**: Integrates **Retell AI** to notify users via phone calls about suspicious transactions.
- **Communication via Twilio**: Sends SMS and email alerts using **Twilio** for instant communication.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed to handle large datasets and integrate with existing financial systems.

## **Tech Stack**
### **Machine Learning & Backend**
- **Python**: Primary programming language for building the system.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **XGBoost**: For high-performance gradient boosting.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **FastAPI**: For building a high-performance REST API to serve predictions.

### **Communication & Notifications**
- **Retell AI**: Powers phone call notifications for real-time alerts.
- **Twilio**: Enables SMS and email notifications for flagged transactions.

### **Frontend (Optional)**
- **Next.js**: For building a modern, responsive frontend.
- **React**: For creating interactive user interfaces.

### **Deployment**
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration and scaling (optional).
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For cloud deployment.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Financial transaction data is ingested into the system in real-time.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis.
3. **Fraud Detection**: The machine learning model analyzes the transaction and assigns a fraud probability score.
4. **Notification**:
   - If a transaction is flagged as suspicious, **Retell AI** initiates a phone call to notify the user.
   - **Twilio** sends an SMS and email alert with transaction details.
5. **Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard displays flagged transactions, fraud trends, and system performance metrics.
